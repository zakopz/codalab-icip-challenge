Codalab Code for the Challenge (Link:https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/25104) organized for ICIP 2020. The goal of the challenge was to develop a method to do real-time distortion classification in laparoscopic videos.

## Introduction and Challenge Significance

Laparoscopic videos may be affected by different kinds of distortions during the surgery, resulting in a loss of visual quality. To prevent any disruptions in 
surgery due to video quality issues, there is a great need of having automated video enhancement systems. For any automated video enhancement system, the feedback
loop plays an important part whereby any change in video quality is handled by applying the correct enhancement approach. In this feedback loop, one of the most 
critical steps is the identification of distortion affecting the video in real-time to allow timely application of enhancement. The purpose of this challenge is 
to target this problem by developing a fast, unified and effective algorithm for real-time classification of distortions within a laparoscopic video. 
In order to complete this challenge, we provided our own dataset of short duration laparoscopic videos called the Laparoscopic Video Quality (LVQ) database. 
These videos were carefully selected from an existing public dataset and were distorted with either single or multiple distortions simultaneously at 
different levels. In total, 800 such videos were provided out of which a sample data of 200 is already available publicly.
