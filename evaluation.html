<h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
<p>The submissions would be judged on two following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Speed of the algorithm:&nbsp; The submissions will be run on Windows OS on an intel core i-7 system with 32 GB RAM and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050. A smaller running time would be given a higher score provided that the algorithm scores well on the second criteria</p>
<p>2. Classification criteria:&nbsp; The submissions would be judged on their implementation using a classification score based on a weighted combination of classification accuracy and F1 score. Equal weight would be given to both. The algorithms would also be tested with a different set of laparoscopic video data than that provided. Moreover, the performance of the algorithm would also be judged separately for videos with single distortion and for those with multiple distortions. More weightage would be given to a method that performs well for the multi-distorted videos.</p>
