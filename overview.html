<h3>Brief Introduction</h3>
<p><span>Laparoscopic videos may be affected by different kinds of distortions during the surgery, resulting in a loss of visual quality. To prevent any disruptions in surgery due to video quality issues, there is a great need of having automated video enhancement systems. For any automated video enhancement system, the feedback loop plays an important part whereby any change in video quality is handled by applying the correct enhancement approach [1]. In this feedback loop, one of the most critical steps is the identification of distortion [2] affecting the video in real-time to allow timely application of enhancement. The purpose of this challenge is to target this problem by developing a fast, unified and effective algorithm for real-time classification of distortions within a laparoscopic video. In order to complete this challenge, we will provide our own dataset of shortduration laparoscopic videos called the Laparoscopic Video Quality (LVQ) database. These videos have been carefully selected from an existing public dataset and have been distorted with either single or multiple distortions simultaneously at different levels. In total, 800 such videos would be provided out of which a sample data of 200 is already available publicly.</span></p>

<h3>Challenge Significance</h3>
<p><span>A good video quality is an essential requirement for laparoscopic surgery. The distortions in a laparoscopic video not only affect a surgeon&rsquo;s visibility but also degrade the results of subsequent computational tasks in robot-assisted surgery and imageguided navigation systems. These tasks include segmentation, instrument tracking [3] and augmented or mixed reality [4]. The distortions in a laparoscopic video appear either because of technical problems in the equipment [5] or due to side-effects of the instruments being used (e.g. smoke with diathermy). In order to tackle such problems, most of the existing solutions rely on making some changes to the technical equipment using one of the many available troubleshooting options. However, all such solutions are time-consuming and may not always solve the problem at hand requiring eventually a specialist technician or a change in equipment. To handle these problems more effectively, automated video enhancement systems need to be employed.</span></p>
